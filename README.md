# Calculator-2-Tkinter-GUI-

**GUI Initialization:**
Use Tkinter to create a main window for the calculator.
Set the title of the window to "Simple Calculator."

**Display Area:**
Include an Entry widget for displaying the input and output of the calculator.

**Buttons:**
Create buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), decimal point, and special buttons (like equals).
Each button is associated with a function that updates the display area based on user input.

**Handling User Input:**
Define functions to handle user input. For example, a function for digit buttons to append the clicked digit to the display.
Include a function for operators that performs the calculation when the equals button is pressed.

**Updating Display:**
Update the display area in response to user input or calculation results.
Ensure proper handling of errors, such as division by zero or invalid input.

**Tkinter Main Loop:**
Start the Tkinter event loop to run the GUI application, allowing users to interact with the calculator.

A simple calculator in Tkinter involves creating a user-friendly interface with buttons and incorporating logic to handle user input and perform calculations. The design should consider both the visual representation and the underlying functionality of the calculator.
